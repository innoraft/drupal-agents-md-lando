# Drupal AGENTS.md Template

**Give AI context about your Drupal project.**

[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) template for Drupal projects. AI reads it once and knows your architecture, standards, and workflows.

**Assumes Lando-based development.**

## Quick Start

**1.** Download template:

```bash
curl -o AGENTS-TEMPLATE.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droptica/drupal-agents-md/main/AGENTS-TEMPLATE.md
```

**2.** Copy this prompt to your AI tool:

```
I need you to customize AGENTS-TEMPLATE.md for my Drupal project and save it as AGENTS.md.

Please:
1. First, copy AGENTS-TEMPLATE.md to AGENTS.md. Make ALL changes directly in AGENTS.md file, not in chat memory - this prevents losing changes.
2. Create a temporary file `./tmp/agents-md-tasks.md` and copy the checklist below. Mark tasks as `[x]` when completed.

--- CHECKLIST START (copy to ./tmp/agents-md-tasks.md) ---

# AGENTS.md Customization Checklist

## Phase 1: Project Discovery
- [ ] Check composer.json for project name, Drupal version, PHP version
- [ ] Check if Lando is used (.lando.yml exists)
- [ ] Check web root directory name (web/, docroot/, html/, or other)
- [ ] Check if multisite (web/sites/ or docroot/sites/ has multiple directories)
- [ ] Check languages (config/sync/language.entity.*.yml or via drush if available)
- [ ] Check if Commerce is installed (composer.json has drupal/commerce)
- [ ] Check if JSON:API or GraphQL is used (composer.json has drupal/jsonapi_extras or drupal/graphql)
- [ ] List all custom modules in web/modules/custom/ or docroot/modules/custom/
- [ ] Check theme name (web/themes/custom/ or docroot/themes/custom/)
- [ ] Discover theme structure (active theme, file organization, template suggestions)
- [ ] Check if theme uses Single Directory Components (SDC)
- [ ] List preprocess functions in the active theme
- [ ] List content types from config/sync/node.type.*.yml
- [ ] Discover other entity types (paragraphs, media, taxonomies, custom entities)

## Phase 2: Replace Placeholders
- [ ] Replace [PROJECT_NAME] - from composer.json
- [ ] Replace [VERSION] - Drupal version from composer.json
- [ ] Replace [PHP_VERSION] - from composer.json require
- [ ] Replace [REPOSITORY_URL] - leave empty or check .git/config
- [ ] Replace web/ - replace with actual web root directory name throughout entire file
- [ ] Replace [PREFIX] - determine custom module prefix (e.g., myproject_, custom_)
- [ ] Replace [THEME_NAME] - actual theme directory name

## Phase 3: Fill Project-Specific Sections
- [ ] Fill "Current Setup" section based on findings
- [ ] List installed custom modules
- [ ] Document multisite configuration if exists
- [ ] List configured languages
- [ ] Note if Commerce, AI modules, or other integrations are present
- [ ] Document content types and other entities in "Drupal Entities Structure" section

## Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove commented-out sections if not applicable (multisite, commerce, headless, AI, config split)
- [ ] Remove entire sections that don't apply to project (e.g., no SCSS? remove SCSS workflow)
- [ ] Remove tools/patterns not used in project

## Phase 5: Propose Additions
- [ ] List project-specific things found during discovery that are NOT in template
- [ ] Present as numbered list for user to choose (e.g., "1. Add Solr search section", "2. Add custom queue workers docs")
- [ ] Wait for user to respond with numbers to add
- [ ] Add selected items to AGENTS.md - keep additions minimal (save tokens) but preserve all key info

## Phase 6: Finalize
- [ ] Show summary: found / replaced / removed / added
- [ ] Delete the temporary `./tmp/agents-md-tasks.md` file

--- CHECKLIST END ---

3. Read AGENTS.md and follow all HTML comment guides (HOW TO DISCOVER...)
4. Execute all discovery steps from Phase 1
5. **STOP after Phase 1** - show me what you found and wait for my confirmation before proceeding
6. If you're unsure about ANY value (prefix, theme name, etc.) - ASK, don't guess
7. Replace all placeholders from Phase 2 (edit AGENTS.md directly)
8. Fill sections from Phase 3
9. Cleanup from Phase 4
10. **STOP at Phase 5** - show numbered list of proposed additions, wait for my response
11. Add selected items, then finalize (Phase 6)

After customization, show me:
- What you found in the project
- What you replaced/customized
- What you removed
- What you added (from proposals)
```
